 I have no problem with you using it or posting it. I'd be flattered if it gives you some ideas. 
 If you post it with yours, you might mention that it's a work in progress as it could use some fine tuning. 
 I've attached the files for the prototypes. I purposely made the screw holes undersized so they could be drilled 
 and/or tapped for different screw sizes. I used #6 x 1/2" Pan Head Phillips Sheet Metal Screws for the locking screws.
