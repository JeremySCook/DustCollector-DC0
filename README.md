# DustCollector-DC0

![image](logo-template-1-clearwalker3-dust-collector-continue-2.jpg)

Dust collector meant for CNC use with a Rigid vac and DeWalt 611 Spindle https://amzn.to/2FNIMl5 (Amazon) labeled as "JSCook-DC0" to signify this is the initial "0" version.

Attachment meant for use with a small shop vac is also available, and if you need another size, let me know - hi@jeremyscook.com or on Twitter @JeremySCook - and I will try to accomodate.

Uses 12mm magnets to hook base and clamp together, and 10-24 screws for clamp and ring attachments. Buttonhead screws are recommended.
