# DustCollector-DC0
Dust collector meant for CNC use with a Rigid vac and DeWalt Spindle labeled as "JSCook-DC0" to signify this is the initial "0" version.

Attachment meant for use with a small shop vac is also available, and if you need another size, let me know - hi@jeremyscook.com or on Twitter @JeremySCook - and I will try to accomodate.

Uses 12mm magnets to hook base and clamp together, and 10-24 screws for clamp and ring attachments. Buttonhead screws are recommended. More info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIhFcK5mLU0
